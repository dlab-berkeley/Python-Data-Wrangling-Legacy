    "This workshop's goal&mdash;which is facilitated by this Jupyter notebook&mdash;is to give attendees the confidence to use `pandas` in their research projects. Basic familiarity with Python *is* assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is designed to make it easier to work with structured data. Most of the analyses you might perform will likely involve using tabular data, e.g., from .csv files or relational databases (e.g., SQL). The `DataFrame` object in `pandas` is \"a two-dimensional tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The `pandas` name itself is derived from *panel data*, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets, and *Python data analysis* itself. After getting introduced, you can consult the full [`pandas` documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate this workshop, we'll work with example data and go through the various steps you might need to prepare data for analysis. You'll (hopefully) realize that doing this type of work is much more difficult using Python's built-in data structures."

This is good practice and is especially important when using `pandas`'s `.plot()` method because the x-axis values are based on the indices. When we sort, the index values remain unchanged. Thus, we need to reset them. The `drop` parameter tells `pandas` to construct a `DataFrame` *without* adding a column."
