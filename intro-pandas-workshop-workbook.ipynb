    "`pandas` is designed to make it easier to work with structured data. Most of the analyses you might perform will likely involve using tabular data, e.g., from .csv files or relational databases (e.g., SQL). The `DataFrame` object in `pandas` is \"a two-dimensional tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "To motivate this workshop, we'll work with example data and go through the various steps you might need to prepare data for analysis. You'll (hopefully) realize that doing this type of work is much more difficult using Python's built-in data structures."
