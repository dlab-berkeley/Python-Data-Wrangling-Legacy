    "`pandas` is designed to make it easier to work with structured data. Most of the analyses you might perform will likely involve using tabular data, e.g., from .csv files or relational databases (e.g., SQL). The `DataFrame` object in `pandas` is \"a two-dimensional tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "To motivate this workshop, we'll work with example data and go through the various steps you might need to prepare data for analysis. You'll (hopefully) realize that doing this type of work is much more difficult using Python's built-in data structures."

    "The best way to get a sense of this data is to **plot it.** Next, we'll start to look at some basic plotting with `pandas`. Before we begin, let's sort the data by country and date. This is good practice and is especially important when using `pandas`'s `.plot()` method because the x-axis values are based on the indices. When we sort, the index values remain unchanged. Thus, we need to reset them. The `drop` parameter tells `pandas` to construct a `DataFrame` *without* adding a column."
